# üèõÔ∏è Legatia DAO Implementation Plan
## Phase 4: Governance & Economics Implementation

> **Aligned with Legatia Milestones**: Building on the completed v1.0 foundation to implement democratic governance and enhanced tokenomics

---

## üìã Context from Milestones

Based on the roadmap, we're implementing **Phase 4** features:
- ‚úÖ **Foundation Complete**: v1.0 with profiles, families, tokens, and security
- üéØ **Current Target**: DAO governance framework and enhanced LGT tokenomics
- üì± **Mobile Ready**: Aligns with Phase 2 mobile applications
- ü§ñ **AI Integration**: Prepares for Phase 2 AI-powered intelligence

## üó≥Ô∏è DAO Governance Framework

### 1. Family Governance (Primary Use Case)
```rust
// Family-level governance structures
pub struct FamilyDAO {
    pub family_id: String,
    pub admin: Principal,
    pub governance_enabled: bool,
    pub voting_threshold: u8,        // % of family members needed
    pub proposal_cooldown: u64,      // Time between proposals
    pub active_proposals: Vec<u64>,
}

pub enum FamilyProposalType {
    ChangeAdmin(Principal),           // Transfer family admin rights
    ModifyVisibility(bool),           // Change family visibility settings
    AddMember(FamilyMemberRequest),   // Propose new family member
    RemoveMember(String),             // Remove controversial member
    UpdateFamilyInfo(UpdateRequest),  // Change family description/name
    EventValidation(String),          // Validate disputed family events
}
```

**Family Governance Use Cases:**
- **Admin Succession**: Vote on new family administrators when current admin is inactive
- **Disputed Members**: Democratic decision on controversial family additions
- **Privacy Changes**: Collective decision on family visibility settings
- **Event Validation**: Community verification of family events and relationships

### 2. Platform-Wide Governance
```rust
pub enum PlatformProposalType {
    FeaturePriority(String),          // Vote on next features to develop
    RewardParameters(RewardConfig),    // Adjust token reward amounts
    PlatformStandards(DataStandard),  // Genealogy data format standards
    PartnershipApproval(Partnership), // Approve external integrations
    TreasuryAllocation(TreasuryPlan), // Community fund distribution
    CommunityGuidelines(Guidelines),  // Platform usage policies
}
```

### 3. Proposal System Implementation
```rust
pub struct Proposal {
    pub id: u64,
    pub proposer: Principal,
    pub proposal_type: ProposalType,
    pub title: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub category: ProposalCategory,
    
    // Voting parameters
    pub voting_starts: u64,
    pub voting_ends: u64,
    pub execution_delay: u64,
    pub quorum_required: u128,
    
    // Vote tracking
    pub yes_votes: u128,
    pub no_votes: u128,
    pub abstain_votes: u128,
    pub unique_voters: HashSet<Principal>,
    
    // Status and execution
    pub status: ProposalStatus,
    pub executable_actions: Vec<ExecutableAction>,
    pub execution_results: Vec<ExecutionResult>,
}

pub enum ProposalStatus {
    Discussion,     // 3-day discussion period
    Active,         // 7-day voting period  
    Passed,         // Approved, awaiting execution
    Executed,       // Successfully executed
    Failed,         // Rejected by voters
    Expired,        // Voting period ended without quorum
}
```

### 4. Dispute Resolution Mechanism
```rust
pub struct DisputeResolution {
    pub dispute_id: u64,
    pub family_id: String,
    pub disputed_item: DisputeItem,
    pub complainant: Principal,
    pub defendant: Principal,
    pub evidence: Vec<Evidence>,
    pub arbitrators: Vec<Principal>,    // Community-selected arbitrators
    pub resolution: Option<Resolution>,
    pub appeal_deadline: u64,
}

pub enum DisputeItem {
    FamilyMembership(String),          // Disputed family member
    RelationshipAccuracy(String),      // Questioned family relationship
    EventAuthenticity(String),         // Disputed family event
    PrivacyViolation(String),         // Privacy setting disputes
}
```

---

## üí∞ Enhanced LGT Tokenomics

### 1. Contribution Rewards System
```rust
pub struct ContributionRewards {
    // Base rewards for family contributions
    pub add_family_member: u128,      // 100 LGT per member
    pub add_family_event: u128,       // 50 LGT per event
    pub complete_profile: u128,       // 200 LGT for complete profiles
    
    // Verification rewards
    pub verify_member: u128,          // 25 LGT for verifying others' data
    pub resolve_dispute: u128,        // 500 LGT for successful arbitration
    
    // Governance participation
    pub create_proposal: u128,        // 50 LGT for creating proposals
    pub vote_participation: u128,     // 10 LGT per vote cast
    pub discussion_contribution: u128, // 5 LGT per substantive comment
    
    // Quality bonuses
    pub data_accuracy_bonus: f64,     // Multiplier for verified accurate data
    pub community_endorsement: u128,  // Bonus for community-endorsed contributions
}
```

### 2. Staking Mechanisms
```rust
pub struct StakingSystem {
    pub family_admin_stake: u128,     // Required stake to be family admin
    pub proposal_stake: u128,         // Stake required to create proposals
    pub arbitrator_stake: u128,       // Stake to serve as dispute arbitrator
    pub verification_stake: u128,     // Stake to provide data verification
    
    pub staking_rewards: StakingRewards,
    pub slash_conditions: SlashConditions,
}

pub struct StakingRewards {
    pub admin_annual_yield: f64,      // 5% annual yield for family admins
    pub arbitrator_fee_share: f64,    // Share of dispute resolution fees
    pub verification_rewards: u128,   // Rewards for accurate verifications
}
```

### 3. Reputation System
```rust
pub struct ReputationScore {
    pub user: Principal,
    pub family_contributions: u64,    // Number of family additions
    pub verification_accuracy: f64,   // Accuracy of data verifications
    pub governance_participation: u64, // Number of votes cast
    pub dispute_resolution_score: f64, // Success rate in dispute resolution
    pub community_endorsements: u64,  // Endorsements from other users
    
    pub overall_score: f64,
    pub voting_weight_multiplier: f64, // 1.0 - 2.0x voting power
}
```

### 4. Family Treasury System
```rust
pub struct FamilyTreasury {
    pub family_id: String,
    pub total_balance: u128,
    pub contributed_by_members: HashMap<Principal, u128>,
    pub spending_proposals: Vec<SpendingProposal>,
    pub automatic_allocations: AutoAllocations,
}

pub struct SpendingProposal {
    pub purpose: TreasuryPurpose,
    pub amount: u128,
    pub recipient: Option<Principal>,
    pub votes_required: u128,
    pub deadline: u64,
}

pub enum TreasuryPurpose {
    FamilyReunion(EventDetails),      // Fund family gatherings
    HistoricalResearch(ResearchPlan), // Fund genealogy research
    DigitalPreservation(PreservationPlan), // Fund document digitization
    CommunityReward(RewardDetails),   // Reward family contributions
    EmergencyFund(EmergencyDetails),  // Emergency family support
}
```

### 2. Cross-Canister Integration
```rust
// Integration with existing Legatia backend
impl DAOCanister {
    pub async fn verify_family_membership(&self, user: Principal, family_id: String) -> bool {
        let backend_canister = get_backend_canister();
        match backend_canister.get_family(family_id).await {
            Ok(family) => family.members.iter().any(|m| {
                m.profile_principal.as_ref() == Some(&user) || family.admin == user
            }),
            Err(_) => false,
        }
    }
    
    pub async fn get_user_reputation(&self, user: Principal) -> ReputationScore {
        // Calculate reputation based on:
        // - Family contributions from main backend
        // - Token reward history from token canister  
        // - Governance participation from DAO canister
        // - Community endorsements
    }
}
```

### 3. Frontend Integration
```typescript
// New DAO-specific components
interface DAOInterface {
  // Family governance
  FamilyGovernanceDashboard: Component;    // Family-specific DAO interface
  CreateFamilyProposal: Component;         // Propose family changes
  FamilyVotingInterface: Component;        // Vote on family proposals
  FamilyTreasuryManager: Component;        // Manage family funds
  
  // Platform governance  
  PlatformProposalList: Component;         // Browse platform proposals
  CreatePlatformProposal: Component;       // Submit platform improvements
  GovernanceStats: Component;              // DAO participation metrics
  ReputationDashboard: Component;          // User reputation tracking
  
  // Staking and rewards
  StakingInterface: Component;             // Stake tokens for governance
  RewardsDashboard: Component;             // Track contribution rewards
  TreasuryDashboard: Component;            // View platform treasury
}
```
