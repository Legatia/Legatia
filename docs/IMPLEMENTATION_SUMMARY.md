# Implementation Summary

This document outlines the key implementation steps and troubleshooting performed to set up and verify the Legatia project's backend and frontend components.

## Backend Canister Recreation

The backend canisters were recreated from scratch, as the previous backend folder was deleted. This involved:

-   **Directory Structure:** Re-establishing the `backend/src/profiles`, `backend/src/families`, `backend/src/relationships`, and `backend/src/invites` directories, each with its own `src/` subdirectory.
-   **Placeholder Files:** Creating `Cargo.toml`, `.did`, and `src/lib.rs` placeholder files for each canister.
-   **Rust Code Updates:**
    -   Renamed `main.rs` to `lib.rs` in each canister's `src/` directory to align with Rust library crate conventions.
    -   Updated `Cargo.toml` dependencies for `candid`, `ic-cdk`, and `ic-cdk-macros` to compatible versions (`0.10.14`, `0.18.5`, `0.8.4` respectively).
    -   Refactored canister logic in `lib.rs` to use `thread_local!` and `RefCell` for state management, which is the idiomatic way for `ic-cdk` canisters, resolving previous `setup` function and `Principal` import errors.
-   **DFX Configuration (`dfx.json`):**
    -   Ensured `dfx.json` correctly defines the custom canisters and their `candid` and `wasm` paths.
    -   Modified the `build` commands for each canister to execute `cargo build -p <canister_name>` from the `backend` directory, ensuring `.wasm` files are generated in the correct `target` location.
-   **Cargo Workspace:** Created a `backend/Cargo.toml` as a workspace root to manage all backend canisters, allowing `cargo build -p` to function correctly. Removed `dev-dependencies` from the workspace `Cargo.toml` as it's not allowed in virtual manifests.

## Frontend Build Setup and Troubleshooting

The frontend build process was configured and debugged to ensure successful compilation and deployment.

-   **Missing Configuration Files:** Created `frontend/tsconfig.json` and `frontend/tsconfig.node.json` to provide TypeScript configuration for the project.
-   **Vite Configuration:** Created `frontend/vite.config.js` to configure the Vite build process, including:
    -   Setting `root: '.'` for correct path resolution.
    -   Configuring a proxy for `/api` to `http://localhost:4943` for local `dfx` integration.
    -   Adding `@src` and `@dfinity` aliases for improved module resolution.
-   **Missing Source Files:** Created `frontend/src/main.tsx` and `frontend/src/index.css` as entry points for the React application.
-   **Dependency and Import Issues:**
    -   Installed `@types/node` to resolve `process` related TypeScript errors.
    -   Replaced `qrcode.react` with `react-qr-code` due to persistent import and type declaration issues with the former.
    -   Corrected import statements in `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` and `src/services/profiles.ts`.
    -   Ensured `Profile` type was correctly exported from `src/services/profiles.ts`.

## Testing Setup

Unit testing environments were configured for both frontend and backend components.

-   **Backend (Rust):**
    -   Added `ic-cdk-test` as a `dev-dependency` to individual canister `Cargo.toml` files.
    -   Created `backend/src/profiles/tests/profiles_test.rs` with a basic test case for `set_profile` and `get_profile`.
    -   Resolved `ic-cdk-test` dependency resolution issues by ensuring it was correctly added to individual canister `Cargo.toml` files.
-   **Frontend (TypeScript/React):**
    -   Installed Jest, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@types/jest`, `ts-jest`, and `jest-environment-jsdom`.
    -   Configured `frontend/jest.config.js` for TypeScript and React testing, including:
        -   Setting `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'`.
        -   Configuring `setupFilesAfterEnv` for `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
        -   Adding `moduleNameMapper` for `@dfinity` and `src` aliases.
        -   Configuring `transform` rules for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and `.jsx` files using `ts-jest` and `babel-jest`.
        -   Adjusted `transformIgnorePatterns` to correctly transpile `dfx` generated files and other ES modules in `node_modules`.
    -   Created `frontend/babel.config.js` with `preset-env`, `preset-react`, and `preset-typescript`.
    -   Created `frontend/setupTests.js` to polyfill `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, and `fetch` for the Jest environment.
    -   Mocked `dfx` generated canister IDs and `idlFactory` in `profiles.test.ts` to enable isolated testing of service functions.
    -   Refactored `profiles.ts` to export a `getProfilesCanister` function, allowing for easier mocking in tests.

## Verification

-   **Backend Canister Functionality:** Verified basic functionality of the `profiles` canister by successfully calling `set_profile` and `get_profile` using `dfx canister call`.
-   **Frontend Service Tests:** Successfully ran frontend unit tests for the `profiles` service, confirming its ability to interact with mocked canister functions.

The project now has a rebuilt backend and a functional frontend build process, along with a basic testing setup for both components.
