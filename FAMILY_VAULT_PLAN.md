# Family Vault Feature - Comprehensive Planning Document

## Overview
The Family Vault is a financial management system that allows families to:
1. Pool and manage common funds collectively
2. Set up inheritance locks with time-based or condition-based releases
3. Create digital wills with automatic distribution
4. Track family financial activities and decisions

## Core Features

### 1. Family Treasury Management
- **Common Fund Pool**: Families can deposit ICP tokens into a shared vault
- **Multi-signature Approval**: Major transactions require approval from multiple family admins
- **Spending Categories**: Categorize expenses (education, healthcare, emergency, etc.)
- **Budget Management**: Set monthly/yearly budgets for different categories
- **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail of all vault activities

### 2. Inheritance & Will System
- **Digital Wills**: Create legally-binding digital wills stored on-chain
- **Time-locked Inheritance**: Funds locked until specific dates or life events
- **Conditional Release**: Inheritance based on conditions (age, marriage, education completion)
- **Beneficiary Management**: Define primary and contingent beneficiaries
- **Proof of Life**: Periodic check-ins to prevent premature inheritance distribution

### 3. Governance & Permissions
- **Family Council**: Multiple family members can have different permission levels
- **Voting System**: Major decisions require family member votes
- **Emergency Procedures**: Override mechanisms for urgent situations
- **Succession Planning**: Automatic role transfer when current admins are unavailable

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Design

#### 1. Family Vault Contract
```rust
pub struct FamilyVault {
    pub id: String,
    pub family_id: String,
    pub balance: u64, // ICP e8s
    pub admins: Vec<Principal>,
    pub members: Vec<Principal>,
    pub permissions: HashMap<Principal, VaultPermission>,
    pub transaction_history: Vec<Transaction>,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub updated_at: u64,
}

pub enum VaultPermission {
    Admin,          // Full access
    Treasurer,      // Can propose transactions
    Member,         // Can view and vote
    Beneficiary,    // Can receive inheritance
    Observer,       // Read-only access
}
```

#### 2. Will & Inheritance Contract
```rust
pub struct DigitalWill {
    pub id: String,
    pub vault_id: String,
    pub testator: Principal, // Person creating the will
    pub beneficiaries: Vec<Beneficiary>,
    pub conditions: Vec<InheritanceCondition>,
    pub executor: Principal,
    pub status: WillStatus,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub last_proof_of_life: u64,
}

pub struct Beneficiary {
    pub principal: Principal,
    pub member_id: String, // Link to family member
    pub inheritance_percentage: u8,
    pub conditions: Vec<String>,
    pub backup_beneficiaries: Vec<Principal>,
}

pub enum InheritanceCondition {
    TimeDelay { release_date: u64 },
    AgeRequirement { beneficiary: Principal, required_age: u8 },
    EventTrigger { event_type: String, verified: bool },
    ProofOfLifeTimeout { days_without_checkin: u32 },
    MultiSignatureRelease { required_signatures: u8 },
}
```

#### 3. Transaction & Approval System
```rust
pub struct VaultTransaction {
    pub id: String,
    pub vault_id: String,
    pub transaction_type: TransactionType,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub recipient: Option<Principal>,
    pub category: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub proposed_by: Principal,
    pub approvals: Vec<Principal>,
    pub required_approvals: u8,
    pub status: TransactionStatus,
    pub deadline: u64,
    pub created_at: u64,
}

pub enum TransactionType {
    Deposit,
    Withdrawal,
    Transfer,
    InheritanceDistribution,
    Emergency,
}

pub enum TransactionStatus {
    Pending,
    Approved,
    Executed,
    Rejected,
    Expired,
}
```

### Integration with Existing System

#### Database Schema Extensions
```rust
// Add to existing Family struct
pub struct Family {
    // ... existing fields
    pub vault_id: Option<String>,
    pub vault_enabled: bool,
}

// Add to existing FamilyMember struct  
pub struct FamilyMember {
    // ... existing fields
    pub vault_permissions: Option<VaultPermission>,
    pub is_beneficiary: bool,
    pub inheritance_percentage: Option<u8>,
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Vault Creation Flow
1. Family admin navigates to "Family Vault" section
2. Clicks "Create Family Vault"
3. Sets initial parameters:
   - Minimum approval threshold
   - Initial deposit amount
   - Adds family members with permissions
4. Deposits initial ICP tokens
5. Vault is created and ready for use

### 2. Deposit Flow
1. Family member goes to vault dashboard
2. Clicks "Deposit Funds"
3. Enters amount and category
4. Confirms transaction with IC wallet
5. Funds are added to family vault

### 3. Withdrawal Flow
1. Authorized member proposes withdrawal
2. Specifies amount, recipient, and reason
3. Other family members receive notifications
4. Required approvals are collected
5. Transaction is executed automatically

### 4. Will Creation Flow
1. Family member goes to "Digital Will" section
2. Specifies beneficiaries and inheritance percentages
3. Sets conditions and timeframes
4. Designates executor
5. Will is stored on-chain with cryptographic proof

### 5. Inheritance Distribution Flow
1. Conditions are monitored automatically
2. When conditions are met, notifications are sent
3. Executor or automated system initiates distribution
4. Beneficiaries receive their inheritance
5. All transactions are recorded immutably

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Require additional verification for large transactions
- **Time Delays**: Mandatory waiting periods for significant withdrawals
- **Emergency Freezing**: Ability to temporarily freeze vault in case of compromise
- **Principal Verification**: Ensure only verified family members can access funds

### 2. Smart Contract Security
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevent attacks during token transactions
- **Integer Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations for all calculations
- **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Ability to upgrade contracts while preserving data
- **Emergency Stops**: Circuit breakers for emergency situations

### 3. Legal & Compliance
- **KYC Integration**: Optional identity verification for large amounts
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Follow local inheritance and financial laws
- **Audit Trails**: Complete transaction history for legal purposes
- **Dispute Resolution**: Mechanisms for handling family disputes
